# wdi-project-2
First RESTful app


- created wireframes
- planned out models
- planned and created file structure
- installed all packages

- express and router in app.js, created home route
- header with basic navbar

- created venue model
- added data of 2 venues to create-data.js

- create index route
  (forgot to link mongoose in app.js!)
- test index.ejs
- run create-data  
- populate index.ejs

- create show route (routes, venueController)
- populate show.ejs
- test
  (weird linters - JSX elements )

- add new and create routes
- add new form

- add create route
 (watch out for url in the form!)

- add edit and update routes

- add delete button
- delete route
(edit route and/or form broke) --- somehow managed to change the url in show.ejs (strange, because I'm not aware of doing that and it was correct before)

(linter is freaking out: in edit.js )
parsing error: adjacent jsx elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. did you want a jsx fragment <>...</>? (Fatal). It gave me 39 errors in the same file before; I changed the linter settings (it kept saying that react variable is not in scope "react/react-in-jsx-scope")

- user model
- register and login login form
- register and login form routes
- register and login routes (express session)
- logout route



TO DO: 
go back on show page (to go to index) and on edit (to cancel editing) + cancel login/register?
